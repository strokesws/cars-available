# webpack-tailwind-babel-boilerplate
webpack-tailwind-babel-boilerplate is a fully configured boilerplate repository with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/ "webpack"), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ "Babel") and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS") as well as all of the required loaders.

webpack-tailwind-babel-boilerplate consists of 2 webpack configs - production and development. This repo uses webpack caching and Tailwind purge to delete unused CSS and keep the distribution files small.

## Usage:
1. 	Clone the repository.

2. 	Run  `npm install` inside the cloned repository.

3.	When developing, use `npm run start-dev` to run webpack-dev-server.

4. To build your application use `npm run build`. Keep in mind that building the app deletes unused Tailwind classes.
